### Tinker introduction
Tinker is the WeChat team's open source Android thermal recovery tool that supports hot updates for DEX, library, and resources. About the basic access methods Tinker, Api and principles, in the official wiki has a very detailed introduction. I'm here to describe the access process (client and background) based on our project, the use of gestures and the problems encountered, and how to build patch packages on Jenkins.
#### Integrated WeChat Tinker, hot patch fixes problems in time
The use of TinkerPatch, a key integrated TinkerPatch platform to help you do the work, provides background patch hosting, version management, guarantee the transmission security and other functions, so you need not to build a background, without concern for the deployment of the operation, only the introduction of a SDK Tinker can be used immediately.
